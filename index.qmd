This blog is entitled "Forest sense". Forests enliven our senses, and if we are sensible, we will sense the forest with all the tools at our disposal to conserve them for generations to come. Forests make sense for humanity. 

I also write about [urbanism](https://shriv.github.io/e-flaneur/) and [data science](https://shriv-portfolio.netlify.app/).
